**Chapter 2 - I’ve Seen Weirder Things On The Internet**

I knew staying up until four in the morning was a bad idea. After watching Vertigo’s stream, one more video turned into two, and two to three. I started out by watching more Vertigo clips, then food reviews, gaming speedruns, and then somehow a video on the history of cheese. Now, my eyelids felt like dumbbells. Maybe I could close my eyes for just one second… 

“Luke,” a low voice growled. 
 
I jerked up. Mr. Krul, my math teacher—and biggest fan, at that—stood at the front of the class, arms crossed across his chest, shooting lasers at me with his eyes.
  
“Last time I checked, naptime was for kindergarteners,” Mr. Krul said.  

“Sorry,” I muttered as I sat up straighter. I felt my face flush. 
 
Mr. Krul turned around and continued copying down functions and lines and whatnot. I looked down at my notes—completely empty except for one single question I’d copied down at the start of class.  

I sighed and let my gaze wander around the room. 
 
My school had a pretty diverse group of kids—for example, there was Marcus, a beefy dude on the basketball team, who sat at the back, twirling his pencil around in his meaty hands. His expression was blank, probably rewatching highlights of his game in his head.  

There was Jayden, who slouched in his chair at the back of the room. He was always “lost in his own world,” with eyes that were always a little too red, blinking that was too slow, and a suspicious skunky smell clinging to his clothes. He absent-mindedly scribbled skulls into his notebook.  

Katheryne, a girl who always dressed in all-black like it was Halloween, sat behind me. Sighing dramatically and humming musical numbers to herself, she annotated her copy of Macbeth and doodled wilted flowers onto her arm with a black marker.  

Then, of course, there was Sofia, who sat at the very front like always. She was the type of person who had a 4.0, won awards in her sleep, and had a ten-year plan for her future. Plus, she ran, like, every club. Debate, Model UN, Honor Society—you name it. If there was a podium involved, she was there. Teachers loved her, parents used her as an example, and she could probably run for mayor in thirty years. Everyone should’ve worshipped her—if she wasn’t so obnoxious.  

I didn’t realize I was zoning out so noticeably until a familiar evil voice called my name.  
 
“Luke,” Mr. Krul snarled. 
 
I froze and said something intelligent like, “Uh?”  

Mr. Krul gripped his chalk like it was a weapon. “What’s the derivative of this function?” he demanded.  

Everyone turned to look at me.  

On the board were a mess of letters, numbers, and lines. I had no clue what was going on. There was no way I’d be able to solve it—Mr. Krul knew that.  

I glanced around desperately at my classmates. Marcus was still twirling his pen and dreaming about basketball. Jayden was still in dreamy land. Kathryne had her nose deep in Shakespeare. It wasn’t fair—why was he only picking on me?  

Suddenly—  

“The answer is x-squared plus five,” a confident voice answered from the front of the class.  
It was Sofia Morales. Of course.  

Mr. Krul sneered at me, then turned to Sofia. “That’s correct, but next time, I’d like to hear that from Luke.”  

Sofia nodded. I swear I saw her turn around and smirk at me. My face flushed as I shrunk back into my seat as the class moved on.
  
I really, really hated math class. 
 
A half hour later, I was excited to leave as soon as the bell rang. But Mr. Krul had other ideas.  

“You’ll fail this class if something doesn’t change, Liams,” he said.  

*Way to have faith in your student,* I thought.  

Mr. Krul handed me a printed schedule. “You’re going to start receiving tutoring. Peer tutoring. Twice a week, after school, forty-five minutes. You start this Thursday.”  

I glanced at the page. A name written in bold stared back at me.

“Sofia?!”  

“Yes. She generously agreed to volunteer..”  

“Why?”  

“That’s beyond me, as well.”  

I shook my head. “I don’t want a tutor.”  

Mr. Krul crossed his arms. “No, but you need one. You should be grateful.”

Thursday came quickly. I trudged to the library at 3:15, just as I’d been told to.  

In my four years of being a student at Empire City High, I'd never really gone to the library much. I thought it was kind of suffocating—full of students who looked like they were one energy drink away from passing out.  

Sofia was already there, sitting at a desk. Her hair was tied up in a clinically neat ponytail and her pencils were lined up like soldiers.  

“Hey,” I said.  

“You’re late,” she said, barely glancing up.  

“I’m literally on time.”  

“Exactly. You should have been here five minutes early.”  

“That’s the dumbest rule I’ve ever heard.”  

I dropped my backpack down to the ground and slouched into a chair. “So, what now?”  

Sofia pulled out a worksheet. “We’re starting with the basics—reviewing polynomials.”  

I took a look. “Yeah, I think I skipped this day.”  

“Just try your best.”  

The next forty-five minutes were like a cowboy standoff. Peace was hard to keep.  

Sofia scribbled down a formula onto the paper with so much force, her pencil lead broke. “You’re not even pretending to focus.”  

“I am focused,” I argued.  

“By staring at the pages? This one is so easy.”  

“I’m trying to think,” I said. “You know, I learn better when I’m not being micromanaged.”  

“I’m not micromanaging. I’m explaining—”  

“You’re being condescending.”  

“I am not.”  

“You’re treating me like I’m some idiot. You don’t have to explain every single thing—just let me think for a bit.”  

Sofia sighed like she was teaching a toddler how to paint. “You know, I don’t want to be here, either. I only volunteered because Mr. Krul asked, and he’s my reference for the Honor Society,” she said. “I thought I’d be helping someone who wanted to improve—not someone who thinks he’s too high and mighty to try.”  

“Hey, I don’t—”  

Sofia’s phone rang.  

“Time’s up,” she said coolly. She stood and packed up her things with military quickness. “Looking forward to next week.”  

I sat there, stewing.  

“Likewise.”

That night was another ViewTube scrolling session. I lay in my bed, my phone’s screen casting a small light in my dark room.  

I started out with a video reviewing the latest Galaxy Wars movie. Then, a video on the recent jPhone. After a couple of hours, I ended up deep into videos about urban legends and conspiracy theories. I’m not sure what the pipeline there was, but that’s the ViewTube algorithm for you.  

It was all relatively normal—well, as normal as it can be when it’s three in the morning—until an unusual video popped up in my feed.  

The video was titled, “JUMP (real) (not fake) | 240p” with an all-black screen for a thumbnail. The channel that uploaded the video had a string of random numbers and letters for a name, as if a cat sat on their keyboard when they were making their account. The video had no views.  

*It’s probably a weird indie film,* I thought.   

I clicked play.  

The video opened to a grainy scene of an alleyway and a distorted voice in the background. They really needed a new microphone.  

The voice began speaking through the screen, the audio cracking between words.  

“The world, as you know it, is false,” the voice hummed. “Everything is in motion. To move, you must release yourself. The space between where you are, and where you wish to be, is a limitation of only your mind.”  

I squinted at the screen. Weird, the quality was so bad, this had to be some unlisted test video. Or maybe it was meant for an online escape room event.  
	
Suddenly, a dark figure appeared in the middle of the screen. I jumped. “Cheap jumpscare,” I muttered. The figure, completely covered in a black suit, stood still under a dimly lit street light.  
	
“Your body is limited by perception. Break that perception, and space becomes… irrelevant,” the voice buzzed. Then, the figure… disappeared. Not walked, not jumped—just vanished. A second later, they reappeared on a fire escape a few feet above. It was a pretty good edit—no weird cuts and the lighting looked stable.  
	
“You’ve forgotten how to move beyond this plane. But your mind never forgets. Focus, and be unshackled by doubt,” the voice narrated. “After your first jump, your world will never feel solid again.”  
	
The video ended with static.  
	
I sat there, blinking. Then, I shut my laptop and flopped onto my bed.  
	
“Yeah, right,” I scoffed.  
	
Just another weird corner of the internet. I’d seen worse.
