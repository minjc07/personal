**Chapter 1 - Is This Really All There Is?**

Why do people keep asking me what I want to do in the future? I barely know what I’m going to do tomorrow.

I’ve had the same conversation too many times—everyone asking me the same question: “What’s your plan for college?” Then seeing their *disappointed but not surprised* look as I always answer, “Nothing.”

Today was no different.

I sat in Mr. Browning’s office, a cramped room that had seen too many students over the years. The wallpaper peeled off the yellow walls and dust bunnies hid in the corners of the room. If the place didn’t have the faded motivational posters—the ones with inspirational quotes and pictures of students that were way too happy to do their math homework, you could have mistaken it for the janitor’s closet. 

Mr. Browning rummaged through some files from a rusty cabinet and tossed them onto his cluttered desk. He readjusted his thin wire-frame glasses, which were down to his nose, licked his fingers, and began shuffling through the mess. The papers fanned the steam coming from his coffee mug, which read, "World’s Okayest Guidance Counsellor".

When Mr. Browning finally found the file he was looking for—mine—he opened up the folder. It was thin and kind of wimpy.

He took a sip of his coffee and leaned back in his chair. It creaked, warning me of what was coming next.

“So, Luke, your calculus teacher tells me you’ve been having trouble in his class,” Mr. Browning started, giving me a mildly inquisitive look. “Care to explain?”

“Uh, explain what?”

“You’ve failed three assessments in a row.”

“Math’s not really my thing.”

Mr. Browning stared at me blankly, as if this conversation was giving him more gray hairs.

“What do you plan on doing after graduation, Luke?” he asked.

“I was thinking I’d try for the lottery.” 

Mr. Browning stared at me blankly again. “Seriously.”

“I don’t know, yet,” I admitted.

“Well, you must have some idea.”

I shrugged and shook my head.

Mr. Browning stroked his thin brown mustache. He put down my file and turned it towards me. I stared down at my transcript. At the top, my name was printed in faded text. Under it, there were my grades from last year—mostly Cs, one or two Bs—and an awkward blank space where my extracurricular activities and awards should have been.

“You’re a smart kid, Luke. You do well enough to get by—when you try.”

I tugged at my hoodie.

“Here’s the reality—January will be here in the blink of an eye. Soon, all deadlines will close. Then what? It’ll be June, and as all your friends go their separate ways, you’ll be stuck here without options.”

I gulped.

“You can’t coast forever. Either *you* decide who you want to be, or the world will decide for you.”

I didn’t say anything.

Mr. Browning reached under his desk to grab a pamphlet. “Here,” he said, as he handed it to me. “This has information on different colleges, trade schools, and even gap year programs. Take a look through it and think about your goals.”

I took it. The top read, “Choose Your Future!” in big bold, obnoxious letters.

“Thanks,” I said, just to be polite. 

“We’re done here. You can go,” Mr. Browning said.

As I started out the door, he called, “And, Luke, we *will* be getting that calculus grade up.”

Then, I shut the door to the office and walked into the hallway. 

I checked my phone for the time. My shift started in fifteen minutes.

I sprinted out of the school.

By the time I arrived at Tony’s Pizza, I was sweaty, late, and out of excuses.

As I entered the kitchen through the back door, Tony was behind the counter, kneading dough. Every time he pressed down, his wide shoulders bulged with muscle and the tattoo on his forearm flexed. Tony was a big, scary guy. He also made a mean pizza.

“You’re late,” he said. As if I didn’t know that already.

“Yeah, I’m sorry. I had school stuff, then I missed the train—”

“Don’t care. Clock in.” He gave me a look. I immediately shut up and tied on my apron.

The next four hours were a blur. I folded boxes after boxes until my fingers felt like cardboard themselves. I took orders from customers who took ten minutes just to decide their order then switched their minds a thousand times (seriously, choose something before you walk up to the counter). Burned my thumb. Then, to top it all off, some kid broke the soda machine, so I had to mop up a lake of soda and lug a new case of syrup from the backrooms.

During one of the calmer moments in between orders, I spotted a group of guys walking by the window. I could tell they were college students because one of them wore a green ECU jacket.

Seeing them, I couldn’t help but wonder—baking pizzas, cleaning soda machines—was my life going to be like this forever?

At the end of my shift, I stared down at my messy uniform. My sleeves were stained with soda. My pants smelled like grease. I felt like someone had sucked all the energy out of me, like a vampire.

Tony came up to me as I packed up my things.

“Dinner. No more lates,” he said, handing me a flimsy box. Inside were a couple leftover slices of greasy pepperoni pizza.

“Don’t say I don’t do anything for you,” he added.

Later that night, as I was in bed, I received a buzz on my phone. It was a notification from ViewTube. The screen turned on, illuminating the room.

“ViewTube Notification: Vertigo is now live,” the notification read. My thumb lingered over the screen. Well, one video before bed wouldn’t hurt, right? I clicked on the notification, and my phone opened up to a livestream.

A masked, hooded figure waved through the screen. He was on top of a rooftop, in front of a night sky, and harsh wind blew through the microphone.

“What’s up, chat\! Vertigo here, tonight we’re way up high on Grayson Tower\! Highest building in the city\! No harness, no rope, just thoughts and prayers,” the masked figure, Vertigo, whooped. The livechat exploded with concern, cheers, and donations.

***ReddestPanda:*** *This is going on Dwitter later 💀*

***aliliu9:*** *NO WAY THIS IS LEGAL*

***vertigofan23:*** *10$ to jump off?*

I leaned in closer. Vertigo was always pulling stupid stunts on his streams—after all, that was his whole schtick. But his stunts had always usually been crane climbs, rooftop parkour, and subway surfing. Climbing Grayson Tower—the biggest, most heavily regarded building in the city? This was another level of insane.

Vertigo panned the camera to show a sweeping view of the city. All the buildings looked like tiny specks of light, and the cars moved like little ants. Even just the thought of being up on a ledge super high made me feel, well, vertigo. I imagined what it would be like to stand up there, on the ledge of the highest building in the city.

“Man, this is crazy. You can see the whole city from up here,” Vertigo commented.

Throughout the whistle of the wind, a scruff voice called out, “Show’s over\! Come out and put your hands where we can see ‘em\!”

The chat freaked out.

***jineemineevgamer:*** *NO WAY 😭*

***vertigofan44:*** *IT'S THE COPS?*

Vertigo snapped the camera back to himself and whistled. He didn’t seem at all fazed, even a little amused.

“Looks like I gotta go. Thanks for all the superchats—don’t forget to like, comment, subscribe!” Vertigo said. Then the stream ended.

I peered into my reflection from the dark computer screen. Then, I reopened ViewTube. One more video before bed wouldn’t hurt, right?
